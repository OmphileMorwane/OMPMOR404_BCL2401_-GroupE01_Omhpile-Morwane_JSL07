# [JSL07] Submission: Proud of your Progress


## Overview

The objective of this project is to create a personalized certificate of achievement with the "Proud of Your Progress Certificate Generator" by debugging code effectively, and integrating JavaScript functionalities with HTML and CSS for building interactive and visually appealing web applications. This web application requires users to input their name, a personalized message, and the course name to dynamically generate a certificate displayed in a modal.

## Reflections

I have gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, particularly in DOM manipulation, event handling, and form validation. Using the Singleton design pattern gave me a better understanding of how to handle class instances effectively. Creating user interfaces, including modal windows and form validation features, improved my UI design skills and problem-solving abilities. Throughout the project, I've strengthened my project organization and time management skills, ensuring a structured development process. Integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript seamlessly enabled me to create visually appealing and functional web applications. Moving forward, I aim to continue building on these foundations, identifying areas for further growth and setting future learning goals to advance my skills as a web developer student.
